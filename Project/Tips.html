				<h1>How to identify a good NFT?</h1>
				<p>The world of NFT is exciting. The space's artists, builders, and collectors create a vibrant and enjoyable community. However, in a sea of low effort projects, rug pulls, scams, and money grabs, it can be difficult to identify quality projects. This page will guide you how to determine if a project has a potential.</p>

      <h2 class="animate__animated animate__slideInRight"> 1. Community </h2>
<p class="animate__animated animate__slideInRight"> The most important aspect of a successful NFT project is its community. This does not indicate the size of the community. This is easily gamed, and most projects use bots to artificially inflate their social media followings and Discord members in order to scam. All of the most reputable and successful NFT projects have vibrant collector and fan communities. True fandom develops around the best projects' franchises.</p>

		<h2 class="animate__animated animate__slideInLeft">2. Founders</h2>
	<p class="animate__animated animate__slideInLeft">
		When you invest in an NFT project, especially in its early stages, you are investing in the people who will work on it. While cryptocurrency embraces anonymity and pseudonyms, our personal mantra is that we would never invest in a project with non-public founders. If we are considering investing in the project, the team's reputation must be on the line. Take the creators' previous performance into account as well. Have they demonstrated their ability to execute? Can they create a strong brand awareness? Have they a good reputation and social standing? Again, when you invest in an NFT project, you are betting on the people who will run and execute it. Make certain that you have faith in them.

		<h2 class="animate__animated animate__slideInRight">3. The project, Art and Brand</h2>
	  
		<p class="animate__animated animate__slideInRight">&nbsp;Make sure to only invest in NFTs that pique your interest. If you like the art or artist, the story, the smart contract, and the technology, you will feel better about your investment than if it is just pure financial speculation. Consider it this way. Will you have some pride in knowing that you supported an artist whose story has truly inspired you even if the project does not succeed financially? Is it something you'd like to have in your collection to show off in future virtual worlds?</p>

<h2 class="animate__animated animate__slideInLeft">4. Utility</h2>
	<p class="animate__animated animate__slideInLeft">
		Some of the strongest and most reputable NFT projects are pioneering when it comes to utility,which is something we look for when vetting NFT projects and collection. remember an NFT collectible is not just art, but an access token to the experences and communities in web3. what else do get by being a collector of a project?is it status and access your after? is it early to web3 technologies and platforms? is it access to excting digital and physical events? yield in the form of staking?
